    <h1>get started with graphql</h1>
    <small>June 15, 2022</small>

    <h2>skip if you don't like the intros</h2>
    <p>Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL. The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot many people I know.</p>

    <h2>let’s talk about the course</h2>
    <p>Netninja along with freeCodeCamp has come up with this amazing course. Here’s the link. It’s free. I have embed the entire playlist below, you can watch it right here.

    </p>

    <h2>rating 4/5</h2>

    <p>While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is little bit outdated. Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for beginners.</p>
        <div><strong>pace</strong> is remarkably right, it’s neither too fast that you have to go back nor slow that you start doozing
        </div>
       
        <div> <strong>full screencast</strong> of code, I like where I don’t have to see someone’s face too much and the instructor explains things on codepad. So, this was a huge +</div>

        <div> <strong>great example</strong> for the entire tutorial as it covers why GraphQL is an ideal solution. TODO apps wouldn’t do justice to the concepts of GQL</div>


    <h2>what you need to know to do this course?</h2>
    <ul>To do this course you need to know the following pieces of technology:
        <li>NodeJS</li>
        <li>ExpressJS</li>
        <li>ReactJS</li>
        <li>CSS & HTML</li>
        <li>MangoDB</li>

    </ul>
    <div>If you don’t know any of these, there are tutorials on NetNinja itself to help you with it. If you know all of it, (like I did), nothing can be better than this.</div>

    <h2>what you get to learn from this course?</h2>
    <p>This is a full stack graphQL course. It covers everything you would need to make a graphQL app.</p>

    <h3>FOR THE BACKEND</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mutations</li>
        <li>Queries</li>
        <li>Resolvers</li>
        <li>GraphiQL</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>ON THE FRONTEND</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>query/mutation fire</li>
        <li>parameterized query</li>
        <li>composing multiple query</li>
        <li>refetching queries on mutation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>after the course</h2>

    <ul>As I said earlier, the course left a lot of grounds to cover. After you have done the basics you can learn about:
        <li>graphql subscriptions</li>
        <li>@client i.e. managing local state</li>
        <li>typescript support</li>
        <li>authentication/authorization in the app</li>
        <li>writing tests for graphql query/mutations</li>
        <li>paginated queries</li>
        <li>most important: using apolloclient as renderProps which is the current API being used in apollo’s documentation and everywhere in code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>where can I see the final product?</h2>
    <p>If you follow and complete the entire course, you make something like this: <a href="/">my booklist app</a>
    <p>However, the course doesn’t cover how to host it online. I have hosted the entire frontend and backend server for free. If you like to know how to host a React+GraphQL app, subscribe to the newsletter below and whenever I write it, you’ll get it straight into your inbox.</p>
